## Maven Single Module project Example

Can be run with or without parameters

Usage from command line:
* go to the maven-simple directory
* compile: mvn clean compile assembly:single
* execute: java -jar target/helloworld2-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar

All in one jar:
* without downloading dependencies 
* without manually placing them in a location
* without using them as an argument for the program execution

Cool right?
